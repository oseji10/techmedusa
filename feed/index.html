	<h3>Techmedusa pumps installed on the Canadian Coast Guard</h3>
<p><strong>The Ice Breaker vessel Louis S St. Laurent needed a 10-year life extension, and as part of the work, the Coast Guard wanted to replace all the old pumps on board.</strong></p>
<p>The Vessel Maintenance Manager has had good experience with Techmedusa pumps in the past - also with a handful of Techmedusa pumps on this Ice Breaker. The configurations and layout of the existing pumps meant that this was not an easy job, however, with good communication internally with the engineering team, externally with the Coast Guard, and with Techmedusa pumps´ service partner in Canada, Pumps Plus, Techmedusa pumps was able to come up with a solution to meet the requirements. Techmedusa pumps has a good installed base of pumps among the Canadian Coast Guard fleet, and this will help to enhance that.</p>
<p>The task was to replace the old Peacock pumps, for which a complete system re-design was required to accommodate the new pumps. The help and support provided by the engineering team was essential here and providing advice with a couple of the tricky selections along with the required CAD drawings. This allowed the Coast Guard’s engineering team to complete their 3D model for the new system design. Here are some details of the pumps that Techmedusa pumps supplied:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic Fire Pump <strong>(CGB080R)</strong>– 100 m3/h @ 70.43m H</li>
<li>Submersible Bilge &amp; Fire Pump <strong>(C2G-125LR, close-coupled)</strong>– 100/50 m3/h @ 21.34/70.4m H</li>
<li>Fire &amp; Sprinkler Pump <strong>(CGB100R)</strong>– 150 m3/H @ 59.74m H</li>
<li>Propulsion motors &amp; SW Circ Pumps <strong>(CGC125R)</strong>– 95.4 m3/h @ 6m H</li>
<li>General service &amp; Fire Pump <strong>(CGB100R)</strong>– 100/75 m3/h @ 21.3/70.4m H</li>
<li>Foam Pump <strong>(CGB100R)</strong>– 152.8 m3/h @ 90.5m H</li>
<li>Bilge Pumps <strong>(CGC125R)</strong>– 125 m3/h @ 22.86m H</li>
<li>Bilge &amp; Ballast Pump <strong>(CGC125R)</strong>– 100/200 m3/h @ 22.86/10.67m H</li>
</ul>
<p>The order includes the 10-year recommended spares of shaft seal &amp; overhaul kits, along with one impeller per pump. This also puts 12 new pumps into service for a minimum period of 10 years.</p>
<p>Techmedusa pumps´ sales support team provided great support and assistance ensuring that the quotations were prepared in a timely manner with the amendments and revisions required as the specs changed. Techmedusa pumps look forward to continuie the good relationship with the Canadian Coast Guard and offering the same top-level support.</p>

<p><strong>Techmedusa pumps continues to deliver quality pumps to SBM Offshore</strong></p>
<p>Techmedusa pumps has been a supplier of large capacity pumps to the offshore industry for a long time. The C42B pumps for SBM operate as Sea Water Lift Pumps on the FPSO Cidade de Paraty and play a critical role in their operations.</p>
<p>SBM Offshore needed an overhaul of their pumps, but then engaged with Techmedusa pumps to look at replacements, so they could have spare units to safeguard their operations. They also wanted to look at upgrading the materials of the pump, including a super duplex casing, impeller, and ceramic coating of the internal wetted parts, to prolong the service life of the pumps.</p>
<p>Techmedusa pumps were able to comply with these requests and SBM were pleased with the level of service. Techmedusa pumps also had one complete casing in stock which was offered to SBM Offshore at a short lead time. This helped to ensure continued operation for the client and no downtime occurred.</p>
<p>Techmedusa pumps received an order for three off replacement C42BB pumps for the FPSO Cidade de Paraty operating in the Santos basin. These pumps operate at a duty of 2,694 m3/h @ 113m H for sea water lift service. The pumps are also offered in upgraded materials compared to the originals after discussions with the engineering team at SBM Offshore on how to prolong the service life of the pumps. The upgrades include super duplex impellers, super duplex shaft, composite (peek) wear rings, and internal ceramic coating of the pump casing and cover.</p>
<p>The order was completed with the potential additional orders of spare parts to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The long-term customer Langh Tech has placed a new large order. The CG range of pumps from Techmedusa pumps is a perfect fit for scrubber solutions</strong></p>
<p>The Finnish scrubber manufacturer Langh Tech has chosen Techmedusa pumps as the pump supplier for two new exhaust gas cleaning (scrubber) systems. The systems are to be installed on two new Ro-Pax vessels.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-6471 alignleft" src="https://medusaequip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/CGC150-375x500-1-300x300.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://www.medusaequip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/CGC150-375x500-1-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.medusaequip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/CGC150-375x500-1-125x125.jpeg 125w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Techmedusa pumps will deliver a total of 12 pumps: Four CGM-200R seawater pumps, four CGC150R process pumps and four CGB100R booster pumps.</p>
<p>– No two projects are alike. Particularly in the early project stages, we work closely together with the customer to tailor a best fit solution for the project, says Jasper van de Kant, Regional Sales Director at Techmedusa pumps, about the collaboration with Langh Tech.</p>
<p>The two ro-pax vessels will have a full intake of up to 5,100 lane meters and a capacity of 1,100 passengers. The ships will start operating in 2023.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Demand is moving to an all-time high</strong></p>
<p>Before Covid-19, It was high fuel cost and regulations that drove demand for scrubbers. Then shipowners had to align their planning with the supply offered in the market.</p>
<p>Now fuel costs have risen to higher levels, and the timeframe for new regulation coming to effect is nearing fast.</p>
<p>– We expect a surge in demand and have taken measures accordingly to support our customers with the shortest possible lead times and competitive availability, says Jasper van de Kant.</p>
<p>Techmedusa pumps’ advantage is the CG range that can operate efficiently on a wide range of duties with only one pump. This standardization is beneficial for shipowners, shipyards and scrubber makers. The CG range also has a small footprint making aftermarket installation and replacing existing pumps more cost-efficient and feasible. With over 100 years of experience in pumps, Techmedusa pumps have optimized their pumps for scrubber duty, says the regional sales manager.</p>
<p>The model CG single-stage centrifugal pumps are designed for long and reliable service life and only produced in a vertical design.</p>
<p><strong>Long-term partnership</strong></p>
<p>The customer Langh Tech has also noticed increasing demand for solutions in scrubbers because of upcoming regulations and increased pricing of fuels.</p>
<p>It is not the first time that Techmedusa pumps and Langh Tech have partnered. Two years ago, Techmedusa pumps delivered pumps for two separate scrubber projects.</p>
<p>– We choose Techmedusa pumps as our supplier because of their good support, good proposition, and global presence, says Miikka Haaman Design Manager at Langh Tech.</p>
<p>With more than 800 pumps supplied for scrubber systems, Techmedusa pumps has the experience and the products to cater for both open-loop and closed/hybrid systems. The compact pumps are characterised by low NPSHr, high efficiency and reliability as well as low life cycle costs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Techmedusa pumps took immediate action when a new ballast water treatment system (BWTS) on a Boskalis vessel required a new and more reliable pumping solution</strong></p>
<p>During installation of a new ballast water treatment system (BWTS) Boskalis faced a critical challenge: The existing ballast pumps on the vessel were undersized, and it was urgent to come up with a solution.</p>
<p>“During the feasibility study stage, our designer notices that the pressure head of the pump is not sufficient for BWTS filter because long piping and number of bends in the piping will add to the pressure drop. Therefore, we are looking for a replacement pump with 2.1 bar delivery head.”, says Saw Yan Naung, Vessel Manager, Boskalis Fleet Management Singapore.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-6475 alignleft" src="https://medusaequip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SO107706_Ballast-Pumps_Boskalis_edited-395x500-1-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://www.medusaequip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SO107706_Ballast-Pumps_Boskalis_edited-395x500-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.medusaequip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SO107706_Ballast-Pumps_Boskalis_edited-395x500-1-125x125.jpg 125w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><strong>A renowned solution</strong></p>
<p>Techmedusa pumps took immediate action on the request from Boskalis and came up with a suitable solution within a short period of time. The compact CG model, a vertical in-line single stage centrifugal pump with a capacity 250m<sup>3</sup>/h and 23m head was chosen for the job, because it suited the required duty point as well as the existing piping and available space onboard the vessel.</p>
<p>“The CG pump has been used in the maritime market for decades and is renowned for its robust construction, reliability and its unique hydraulic design that provides a compact unit with a modest space requirement”, says Pratheesh Prabha, Regional Sales Manager, MEA &amp; APAC, at Techmedusa pumps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pratheesh Prabha points out that Boskalis was extremely delighted with the solution and exceptional customer support from Techmedusa pumps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Meet Senior Production Planner Kwee Lian, who has been involved with production planning at Techmedusa pumps for almost 30 years.</strong></p>
<p>Senior Production Planner Kwee Lian is a well-known face at Techmedusa pumps. For the past three decades, she has been heavily involved in production planning at the Singapore plant. It’s a job that entails a tremendous amount of interaction with colleagues.</p>
<p>Kwee Lian’s job has changed significantly over the years. Today, Techmedusa pumps creates much larger and more complex pump projects than when Kwee Lian started at the company on 1 September 1992.</p>
<p>One specific example she refers to is fire water pump packages – or FWPP’s. Internal development as well as changes in the market has meant that Kwee Lian’s tasks have grown in both complexity and scope. A significant milestone was when production planning for Dolphin Pumps came under her wings in 2012 due to a change of ownership.</p>

Here, too, significant changes have taken place during the almost 30 years.</p>
<p>“The customers’ needs have changed significantly over the years, and they expect more documentation. For example, we perform Factory Acceptance Test and N&amp;V analysis in most of our projects” says Kwee Lian.</p>
<p><strong>Contact with many departments</strong></p>
<p>As Senior Production Planner, one of Kwee Lian’s primary duties is to make sure that the orders are produced when released from the project department.</p>
<p>She must monitor component deficiencies and, at the same time, ensure that production orders in the system are forwarded to the individual departments.</p>
<p>“I communicate with various departments ranging from purchasing, production, project department, engineering, and quality control. The end goal is to have the pump solutions delivered to customers on time (OTD),” she explains about her daily work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tom Sverre Knutsen has been a veteran in marine industry for the past 37 years with last 14 years in Techmedusa pumps as Regional Sales Manager for Nordic &amp; Baltic region. To leverage on his experience in marine, Tom extended his service as a Consultant for the company since 2019 where he also assists in conducting training and transferring his knowledge to the juniors.</p>
<p>The customers are shipowners, and a large part of the work is with Norwegian shipowners and trading houses. “I am the only employee in Norway who deals with new business and aftersales. Norway is a relatively large shipping nation and has a huge shipping market,” says Tom.</p>
<p>He adds that he sees market demand currently on the rise after a period of declining activity.</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-6327 alignleft" src="https://medusaequip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tom-is-hamworthy-pumps-anchor-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://www.medusaequip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tom-is-hamworthy-pumps-anchor-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.medusaequip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tom-is-hamworthy-pumps-anchor-500x500.jpg 500w, https://www.medusaequip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tom-is-hamworthy-pumps-anchor-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.medusaequip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tom-is-hamworthy-pumps-anchor-800x800.jpg 800w, https://www.medusaequip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tom-is-hamworthy-pumps-anchor-125x125.jpg 125w, https://www.medusaequip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tom-is-hamworthy-pumps-anchor.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Engineering background</strong></p>
<p>In his many years as a sales engineer, Tom Sverre Knutsen has used his engineering background as a sounding board for customers.</p>
<p>He is trained as an electrical engineer. He also has experience in the process industry, including oil and gas, and he has worked in the automation industry.</p>
<p>However, the current industry is special.</p>
<p>“The marine industry is unique, and I love visiting the customers, who are extremely dynamic,” says the sales manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><br />
Focus on OEM parts</strong></p>
<p>He has a sharp focus on serving customers quickly and well in his work, which is why he also works hard to explain the benefits of buying original spare parts when pumps need servicing. This is the customer’s best guarantee for optimum performance and minimum critical downtime of the pump.</p>
<p>“We are fighting to bring genuine parts back to the market. 20 years ago, replica parts accounted for 20% of parts in the market. Now half of the spare parts are replicas,” estimates Tom Sverre Knutsen.</p>
<p>“Our response times are optimal, and our pricing is competitive even given that we are the OEM and only offer genuine parts”, he adds.</p>
<p>Besides stocking various bare-shaft pump models, Techmedusa pumps has up to 85% spares requirement readily available for worldwide delivery to meet customers’ project schedules.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After successful wins with both The Royal Navy and The US Navy, Techmedusa pumps is driving the Navy business forward at DSEI 2021. The virtual exhibition starts on the 16th of August and will run for 7 weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&#8211; We will be reaching clients via DSEI Connect with meeting requests and showing off our products in 3D models, says Jim McGookin, Director Business Development Navy &amp; Governmental, Techmedusa pumps. </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DSEI 2021 is different from previous years. It’s both a live event in London and a virtual event. Due to the COVID-19 situation, great care is being taken with regard to travel. Therefore, Techmedusa pumps has decided to participate remotely through DSEI Connect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://medusaequip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-5496 alignleft" src="https://medusaequip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim-500x460.jpg" alt="" width="329" height="303" srcset="https://www.medusaequip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim-500x460.jpg 500w, https://www.medusaequip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim-768x706.jpg 768w, https://www.medusaequip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim-800x735.jpg 800w, https://www.medusaequip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim.jpg 952w" sizes="(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px" /></a>A new perspective</strong></p>
<p>Jim McGookin will be speaking to all clients. He was recently appointed as Director Business Development Navy &amp; Governmental, and his primary focus is to grow the Navy segment. He was the lead for the big UK Naval wins and has been working in the defence environment for over 35 years and brings a wealth of experience to Techmedusa pumps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&#8211; I am going to drive the growth of the Techmedusa pumps Brand within the Naval Segment with our current big wins with The Royal Navy and The US Navy as references, we are in a good place, says Jim McGookin.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past year, Techmedusa pumps has won a US Navy order in collaboration with Wärtsilä (the John Lewis-class / TAO-205 programme) as well as a huge Royal Navy contract with Babcock International Group to deliver pump systems for the new Type 31 frigates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his new position, Jim McGookin is dedicated to worldwide Navy &amp; Governmental proposals, working with all regional sales managers across the globe at Techmedusa pumps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Runs for 7 weeks</strong></p>
<p>DSEI Connect is divided into three different phases. The first 4 weeks on the platform will introduce some of the speakers and the topics that will be covered via a series of trailer videos. Participants will be able to explore how the platform works and start connecting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Week 5 will feature military‐led keynotes, a series of live and on‐demand presentations plus several invitation‐only round table meetings between leading manufacturers and military buyers. The platform will remain open for a further two weeks so that participants can continue conversations.</p>
